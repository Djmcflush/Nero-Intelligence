# Nero-Intelligence

Machine learning and Language development combined with VR. The goal : teach people different languages from the comfort of there home.


Update :/ because of NDA's that ive signed im no longer allowed to publish to opensource the Project details. What i can say is its portable on iOS and also used unity to develop the VR part of the application. Created the GUI with XD & XCode.
